    <h2>BORN A CRIME BOOK REVIEW</h2>
    <img src="Images/Trevor-Noah-Born-a-Crime.jpg" height=500>
 <em> <b><p>Born a Crime. My latest favourite book by Trevor Noah, focuses on a young boy growing 
        up in Soweto at the time of apartheid. He lives a hard life but uses humour to navigate
        through his journey.
    </p> </em> </b>
    
    <p>My first blog is about Trevor Noah's stepdad, Abel. On the 18th chapter on <b> Born a crime </b> <em>My mother's life</em> 
        We get a deeper understanding on Abel. When Patricia first knew him, he is said to be timid and calm 
        and Trevor really liked him.
        His abusive and controling nature is seen when he marries Patricia. When Trevor gets
        a chance to visit Abel's home, he encounters Tzaneen women who were so submissive that 
        they practically bowed to the men. Trevor wodered why he never married one of those Tzaneen
        women instead of his mother, since he wanted Patricia to be subservient(something she's not). Patricia described
        him as "an exotic bird collector" and that his dream is to get a woman who is free so that
        he can put her in a cage. This is indeed true when Abel marries her, he tries to control 
        her and when she defies him, he resorts to violent means. He ends up almost killing her
        when he shoots her.
    </p>
    
    <em> <p>Trevor was a unique child, throughout his life he experienced tough situations which 
        he used humor to navigate them. Through his camouflaging capabilities and his humorous 
    lifestyle, he was able to make friends and get out of difficult situations. </p> </em>
    
    <p>My second blog focuses on how Trevor, so fondly uses humour in his life experiences to get him out of difficult situations. <br> One day as Trevor was walking down the street, there came some Zulu guys who were closing
        on him and wanted to beat him and also steal from him. <i>He knew that because of his "Chameleon"
            capabilities to speak different languages,
        </i> so he turned to them and in a very humorous way spoke in fluent zulu telling them
        <em>"Yo guys why don't we just mug someone together, I'm ready lets do it"</em> the 
        Zulu guys were actually shocked and ended up leaving him unscathed.
    </p>
    <p>One of my favourites instances where he uses humour to help him get out of trouble was the
        incident which his friend Tom had dragged him to a dance in their street but failed to 
        mentioned to him that he had promised the people an American rapper. Trevor was forced 
        to perform on stage because failure to do so would have led to serious repurcations.
        He then humorously begins to rap wrong  American rap lyrics, as long as the people
        did not understand English!
    </p>
    <p>My comment on the book <b>Born a crime</b>is that it is a nice read, really funny and
    well thought of in terms of order of events. Far from being humorous, it also focuses on
real issues that affect our community even now, like racism and social oltracism
It sheds light on these issues which is something to note when reading the sensational novel.</p>
